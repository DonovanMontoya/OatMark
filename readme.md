# 🥛 OatMark

**OatMark** is a cross-platform app (iOS, Android, Web) that aims to answer a surprisingly common question:

> _"What kind of oat milk does this coffee shop use?"_

This app is designed to help oat milk drinkers find and share real-time info about the brands used at cafes—whether it's Oatly, Minor Figures, Califia, or a mystery in-house blend.

## 🚀 Project Vision

We’re building OatMark to:

- Make it easier to find coffee shops that serve your preferred oat milk
- Support local cafes by highlighting their plant-based offerings
- Crowdsource and maintain an up-to-date oat milk map of the world

We’re just getting started, and this project is meant to grow over time with user feedback, contributors, and more features.
